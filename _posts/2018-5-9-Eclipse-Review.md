title: Eclipse (iOS) Review
---

[Eclipse](https://eclipseemu.me) is a Web-Based emulator for iOS, that runs GBA, GBC, GB, and NES. Since Eclipse is Web-Based, you can add it to your homescreen, and it will stay there, acting as an app, not getting revoked at all. <br>
First, let's go over the Pros of Eclipse. 1: No revokes. Eclipse isn't an installable app, as you use it as a webapp. This means you'll be able to keep it for as long as you want. <br>
However, there are some cons. For example: since Eclipse is Web-Based, it is <i>heavily</i> restricted as to what emulators it can run. <br>
However, Eclipse v2.0.0 is coming soon, when the team finishes up!

>Coincidentally, I have written some code a few hours ago that makes the D-Pad a lot easier to use, and includes the ability to hold to change directions.

This means we're getting a fixed D-Pad! Hyped for the update!
